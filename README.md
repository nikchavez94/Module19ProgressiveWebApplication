# Progressive Web Application

## Overview
J.A.T.E (Just Another Text Editor) is a versatile web-based text editor designed to empower users in creating and managing notes or code snippets seamlessly, whether connected to the internet or not. Leveraging the power of integrated service workers and Cache API, the application guarantees full functionality even in offline mode, ensuring users can reliably access their content at all times.

This text editor employs various data persistence options to safeguard user data. When launched, the application prioritizes indexedDB to populate the editor, seamlessly falling back to local storage if indexedDB access is unavailable. Furthermore, users can download the application to their desktop, allowing for offline usage as a standalone application.

Tailored for developers, J.A.T.E serves as a valuable tool for jotting down code snippets and coding ideas. The user-friendly interface and reliable offline access make it an ideal scratchpad for developers, providing a seamless experience for both online and offline scenarios.
